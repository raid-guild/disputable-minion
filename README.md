# Disputable Minion

Does a Minion introduce perverse incentives to the moloch dao structure? If you use a minion to invest some DAO assets in an external project, those assets are no longer available to members who choose to RageQuit. This breaks the cryptoeconomic alignment that makes Moloch magical. Can we maintain alignment, voice, and exit rights for while also using Moloch extensions like Minion?
